# Trend Charts

Trend charts are a type of data visualization that display the value of one or two variables across different categories (across fields) while also incorporating a view field. They typically feature a line that represents the trend, which is often calculated as the average of the view field for the first category.

## Overview of Trend Chart Types

### 1. Trend View

**Definition:**  
The Trend View is a type of trend chart that displays one across field and one view field. It is particularly useful for visualizing trends over time.

**Key Features:**

- **Fields:**
  - **Across Field:** This is typically a date data type, allowing for various date formats (e.g., day, month, quarter, year).
  - **View Field:** This represents the data points that are being measured (e.g., sales, temperature).

- **Date Formats:**
  - When the across field is a date, the chart can display trends in different formats, such as:
    - Daily
    - Monthly
    - Quarterly
    - Yearly

### 2. Scatter Reference

**Definition:**  
The Scatter Reference chart is a more complex trend visualization that includes two across fields and one view field. It allows for a more detailed analysis of relationships between two variables.

**Key Features:**

- **Fields:**
  - **First Across Field:** This can be a date data type or a non-date field.
    - If it is a date, the chart can display trends in various date formats (similar to the Trend View).
    - If it is a non-date field, the chart will show the average of the second across field.
  - **Second Across Field:** This is typically another variable that is being compared against the first across field.
  - **View Field:** This represents the data points being measured.

- **Date Formats:**
  - Similar to the Trend View, if the first across field is a date, the chart can display trends in different formats (day, month, quarter, year).

## Options to Change Trend

- In properties, we are able to add conditions like showing below/above 5/10/15/20/25 values/percentage records as a response.
- In trend line settings:
  - If the first across is a date field, we are able to change the trend across date, month, quarter, and year.
  - If the first across is a date or non-date field, we are able to add a custom reference, which is like AOPS, allowing us to perform arithmetic operations over the view field.
